    <h1 class="h1">ABOUT</h1>
    <p class="p">Trends is India's largest fashion retail chain across India. Trends offers stylish, high-quality products across Womenswear, Menswear, Kidswear and fashion accessories through a diversified portfolio of own brands, national and international brands.A trend is a change, a movement. It occurs when a color, product, silhouette, pattern, material or style becomes popular in a specific period of time. And by popular we mean that the majority of people adopt, imitate, or replicate a particular style.  

        The concept of trend started in the 14th century when the upper echelons of society demonstrated their social position and wealth also by how often they could change their looks. 
        
        The characteristic of fashion trends is that they rise and fall. The 1900s were characterized by the corset that was then disrupted by Coco Chanel in 1920 who freed women from the restrictions of the previous eras. Instead of creating garments with corsets, she opted for a looser-flowing silhouette to allow women the opportunity for more freedom. 
        
        However even though it’s true that trends emerge and go, if they are particularly short we cannot define them as trends but the correct industry term is fads. Fads are particular styles, colors or micro-trends that come and go very quickly lasting just a couple of weeks, months or one season. Whereas trends instead tend to last for years or decades, evolving and changing as they go,  there could be variations but the silhouette is more or less the same. The perfect example of this is denim. We have seen denim on the runway for years although in different variations. 
        
        How do Fashion Trends Start
        Just like with the example of the pandemic, in the course of history, there have been many shifts in culture, technology, economic and social conditions, and fashion has reflected that with different trends. 
        
        Influences on fashion trends
        Trends are influenced by our culture and society:
        
        pop culture
        television shows
        films
        music
        videos
        current events
        politics
        economics
        The fashion industry influences and creates trends as well of course. Most trends are spotted on the catwalks during fashion weeks. Designers work with trend forecasting agencies that build mood boards for brands with ideas about future colors, patterns, etc. Also, colors used by brands in their collections are not chosen by chance or the creativity/idea/vision of the designer only. Brands take into consideration institutions such as Pantone that study and research the color of the year.
        
        Trends can also be spotted outside of fashion shows with street style looks that play a major role during fashion week just as the runway itself. 
        
        Fashion editors then are those who go to fashion shows and spot the trends on the runway or outside, and spread them to all of us in the next editorials of magazines and articles that suggest what’s trending and what to buy each season.  
        
        Social media, especially TikTok and Instagram, play a big role in the rise or decline of trends. If before celebrities were the only early adopters of new trends and printed issues of magazines were the only place to read about trends, nowadays influencers and social creators can direct consumers’ needs and desires and inform everyone about trends even before an editor writes about them. 
        
        Trends are also dictated by new innovations, new technology and new materials. Think about the Nylon fabric introduced on the runway by Miuccia Prada. 
        
        Celebrities and other high-profile people such as the royal family for example( think of how many articles you saw about Kate Middleton and Megan Markle looks) impact and introduce trends as well. 
        
        Fashion Trends Life Cycle
        Fashion trends go through a five-stage life cycle from introduction when the trend is spotted for the first time, to rise when it becomes popular, up to obsolescence when it’s no longer trending. 
        
        Since trends work in cycles, some of them have returned and will continue to do so after the obsolescence phase. You might have noticed that something in the wardrobe of your parents is now trending again as well or that something you bought years ago but that you haven’t worn for years, is now something you want to wear again. The perfect example is the Nylon bag of Prada. Initially launched in 1984, it became obsolete and recently popular again. The brand relaunched in 2019 the new Re-Edition. Prada’s Re-nylon Re-edition 2000 mini bag has been named Lyst’s ‘Handbag of the Year’ for 2022, almost 40 years after the first nylon bag was introduced on the market. 
        
        Let’s see the fashion cycle of trends.  
        
        Introduction
        The cycle of the trend begins with its introduction. So the first time that a new color, silhouette, material or style is seen. Most of the time we spot new trends on the catwalks when designers present a new collection, clothing worn by celebrities or influencers or by a significant economic and social condition like the pandemic. 
        
        Rise
        This is the phase where that specific trend starts gaining momentum and traction: more influencers and trendsetters wear that specific trend (by choice or nowadays especially on social media by paid promotion. You might have noticed when many influencers promote the same product on the same week) increasing consumer demand. In this phase, the product or look becomes popular and aspirational for the general public. Mass markets and fat fashion brands will start producing (copying)  that trend spotted on the runway and retail stores will stock similar products in response to the increasing demand. 
        
        Peak
        In this phase, the trend has reached all consumers. It’s possible to find that style at the lowest costs available from other brands. Luxury brands at this point are already promoting the new trend. 
        
        Decline
        Trends come and go. The decline phase is reached when the market is oversaturated. That trend is no longer aspirational. 
        
        Obsolescence
        This is the phase when a new trend is rising and so the previous one has become not fashionable anymore. 
        
        The length of a cycle changes from trend to trend. Some trends last longer, and others especially recently, are running faster (hello fast fashion). When a trend is particularly short goes into a hypercycle and produces a fad or micro trend. 
        
        So I hope that after this article you’ll start noticing with different eyes the runway shows, what colors brands use in their collections, how fast-fashion brands replicate the trend launched by a designer, what your favorite influencer is wearing or the latest product you see on TikTok videos</p>
